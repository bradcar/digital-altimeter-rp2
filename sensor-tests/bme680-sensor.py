# bme680 sensor - temp, humidity, pressure, IAC, altitude
#
# bme680 driver code:
#    https://github.com/robert-hh/BME680-Micropython
#
# IAQ (Indoor Air Quality) calculation:
#    IAQ value between 0 and 500, where lower values represent higher air quality.
#    https://github.com/thstielow/raspi-bme680-iaq
#      IAQ:     0- 50 good
#              51-100 average
#             101-150 poor
#             151-200 bad
#             201-300 worse
#             301-500 very bad
