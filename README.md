# digital-altimeter-rp2
Digital Altimeter with adjustments for known altitude/sea-level-pressure using Raspberry Pi Pico2 with BMP390, BME680, OLED Display

## Features of this Raspberry Pi Pico 2 code:
* SSD1309 (SDI) - uses SSD1306 sw, both SDI & I2C code - SDI is faster
  * ssd1306 Framebuffer-based SW for printing text & blit of bitmap images
* BMP390 (I2C1 #76 addr) - highly accurate air pressure, altitude.
  * will be on same I2C bus as BME680, but used as main air pressure and altitude, solder blog makes it #76 addr
* BME680 (I2C1 #77 addr) - for inside temp & humidity, air pressure, air quality, and altitude.
* button debounce that uses efficient interrupt code (does not use CPU cycles with sleep, yay!)
* Temperature from on-board RP2350 (no external pins, ADC4)

## Useful sites:
* maybe going to use: Foriot's TXS0108E 8 Channel Level Converter Module to convert 5v Ultrasonic and SSD1309 to Support Pico 3.3V signals
  * SSD1309 SDI is fast, so I need one that can keep up https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CFL9KN7L
* Powering Pico: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PH9jzRsb5E -- feed, 5v for ultrasonics, and power in my car.
  * TODO get Buck converter 12v car to 5v (to usb-b or micro-usb)
  * For micro-USB and/or external power, best to have MosFET protection
    * recommended DMG-2305ux, but this is surface-mount MosFET
    * investigating RLB8721, that way can hook laptop up in car to update SW

## Other useful sites (used in this code):
* MicroPython Fonts:  https://github.com/peterhinch/micropython-font-to-py/tree/master -- Didn't use it for this project
 
## TODOs
* Determine if SSD1309 should be run on 5v
* Consider putting air quality status in tiny font
* add button for details of all measurments
